1) Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed, this is because in a website we want to make sure that the code that is being deployed is always free of issues. We wouldn't want to push code with bugs to a website that has active users.

3) Navigation mode is more used for analyzing things on page load. Snapshot could be at any point in time.
4) We could add a meta description, specifiy lang attribue, and properly size the images
